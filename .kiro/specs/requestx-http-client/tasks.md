  - Handle network errors, timeouts, HTTP errors, and SSL errors properly
  - Write unit tests for error handling scenarios and exception compatibility
  - _Requirements: 7.2, 1.3_

- [ ] 7. Implement advanced HTTP features
  - Add support for request parameters, headers, data, and JSON payloads with hyper
  - Implement timeout handling using tokio::time, redirect control, and SSL verification options
  - Add proxy support and authentication mechanisms
  - Write unit tests for advanced HTTP features and edge cases
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 1.4, 7.1, 7.2_

- [ ] 8. Create comprehensive test suite
  - Implement unittest-based test suite covering all HTTP methods in both sync and async modes
  - Create integration tests using httpbin.org for live HTTP testing
  - Add compatibility tests to ensure drop-in replacement behavior with requests
  - Implement test coverage measurement and maintain high coverage levels
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4_

- [ ] 9. Set up build system and packaging
