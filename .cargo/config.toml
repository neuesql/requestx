# PyO3 0.28 Performance Optimization
# Note: pyo3_disable_reference_pool was considered but removed because
# this codebase uses many Py<T> types in async contexts which may be
# dropped outside the GIL. The overhead of the reference pool is
# acceptable compared to potential aborts/segfaults.
#
# If you want maximum performance and can guarantee all Py<T> drops
# happen within Python::attach contexts, you can re-enable:
# [build]
# rustflags = ["--cfg", "pyo3_disable_reference_pool"]
