# Analysis of `buffer-size` Optimization

## Summary

The `buffer-size` optimization strategy involved increasing the `http2_initial_stream_window_size` and `http2_initial_connection_window_size` in `config.toml`. This change was intended to improve performance by allowing more data to be buffered before being sent, reducing the number of round trips and improving throughput.

## Benchmark Results

| Metric | Baseline | Optimized | Improvement |
|---|---|---|---|
| Average Response Time (ms) | 0.056 | 0.046 | 21.6% |
| Requests per Second | 1421.06 | 1609.21 | 13.2% |
| Memory Usage (MB) | 14.13 | 14.21 | -0.5% |
| CPU Usage (%) | 38.2 | 39.33 | -2.9% |

## Conclusion

The `buffer-size` optimization was successful. It resulted in a significant improvement in response time and requests per second, with a negligible increase in memory and CPU usage. This indicates that the larger buffer sizes allowed for more efficient data transfer, leading to better performance. Given the positive results, we will proceed with this optimization.
