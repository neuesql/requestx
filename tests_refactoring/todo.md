## Completed Strategies
*None yet - this is the initial setup*

## Testing Framework
- **Benchmark Tool**: `scripts/requestx-benchmark.py`
- **Metrics Collected**: Memory usage, CPU utilization, response time, throughput
- **Test Duration**: 30 seconds per configuration
- **Concurrency Levels**: 128, 512, 1024 concurrent requests
- **Environment**: Local development with controlled conditions

## Documentation Standards
- Each optimization gets its own `optimization-{strategy}.md` file
- Include baseline, implementation details, results, and recommendations
- Track memory usage, CPU impact, and throughput changes
- Document trade-offs and environmental considerations
